# Clean Architecture with .NET 9, EF Core 9 & Fluent API
This project demonstrates a Clean Architecture implementation using .NET 9, Entity Framework Core 9, and the Fluent API for database configuration.
It follows modern software engineering practices to ensure scalability, maintainability, and testability.

üìÇ Project Structure
The project is divided into four main layers as per the Clean Architecture principles:
**‚Ä¢ Domain**
‚Ä¢	Contains Entities, Value Objects, and Domain Interfaces
‚Ä¢	Pure business logic with no external dependencies
**‚Ä¢ Application**
‚Ä¢	Contains Use Cases / Services implementing application-specific logic
‚Ä¢	Uses Interfaces from the Domain layer
**‚Ä¢ Infrastructure**
  ‚Ä¢	Implements repository interfaces using EF Core 9
  ‚Ä¢	Configures the database using Fluent API
  ‚Ä¢	Handles persistence, migrations, and external services
**‚Ä¢ Presentation (API/UI)**(Not implemented yet)
  ‚Ä¢	ASP.NET Core 9 Web API for exposing endpoints
  ‚Ä¢	Interacts with Application layer via Dependency Injection


**‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack**
‚Ä¢	.NET 9 (ASP.NET Core API)
‚Ä¢	Entity Framework Core 9
‚Ä¢	Fluent API (Model configuration & relationships)
‚Ä¢	SQL Server (Database)
‚Ä¢	Dependency Injection
‚Ä¢	Repository Pattern


**üöÄ Features**
‚Ä¢	Clean separation of concerns with Clean Architecture.
‚Ä¢	Fully implemented CRUD operations.
‚Ä¢	Fluent API for entity configuration (relationships, keys, indexes).
‚Ä¢	Repository pattern with EF Core 9.
‚Ä¢	Unit tests for business logic.
‚Ä¢	Easy to extend and maintain.
